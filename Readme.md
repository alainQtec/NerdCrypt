# 📖 Description

    AIO PowerShell module to do all things encryption-decryption.

## How to install:

```powershell
Find-module NerdCrypt | install-Module
```

To build and test the module, run `build.ps1`.

### Encryption

    Applies several paranoid encryptions to an Object or a file.
    Encryption can be applied to any item that can be converted to a byte array.
    This function may currently encrypt Objects (i.e. "System.Object") and files.
    The function employs Rijndael AES-256, Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption (RSA), MD5 Triple D.E.S, and other algorithms.
    Yeah, It gets Pretty paranoid!

    There is an option to store your encryption key(s) in Windows Password vault so that the
    Decryptor Function (Decrypt-Object) can use them without need of your input again.

# 📋 NOTES

    + Most of the methods work. (Most).
    + This file is over a 1000 lines (All in One), so use regions code folding if your editor supports it.
