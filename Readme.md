# SYNOPSIS

    AIO PowerShell class to do all things encryption-decryption.
    
## DESCRIPTION

    All in one Encryption Decryption ps Class.
    Great way of Learning Encryption/decryption methods using PowerShell classes
    
### Encryption 

    AppliesÂ several paranoid encryptions to an Object or a file.
    Encryption can be applied to any item that can be converted to a byte array.
    This function may currently encrypt Objects (i.e. "System.Object") and files.
    The function employs Rijndael AES-256, Rivest-Shamir-Adleman encryption (RSA), MD5 Triple D.E.S, and other algorithms.
    Yeah, It gets Pretty paranoid!

    There is an option to store your encryption key(s) in Windows Password vault so that the
    Decryptor Function (Decrypt-Object) can use them without need of your input again.
        
## NOTES

    + Most of the methods work. (Most).
    + This file is over a 1000 lines (All in One), so use regions code folding if your editor supports it.
    
## Examples
    
```Powershell
PS C:\> # Try this:
PS C:\> iex $((Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get https://api.github.com/gists/217860de99e8ddb89a8820add6f6980f).files.'Nerdcrypt.ps1'.content)
PS C:\> $n = [NerdCrypt]::new("H3llo W0rld!");
PS C:\> $e = $n.Encrypt(3);
PS C:\> $d = $n.Decrypt(3);
PS C:\> [xconvert]::BytesToObject($d);
H3llo W0rld!
