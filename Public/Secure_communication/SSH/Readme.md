# SSH

If you want to establish a secure shell (SSH) connection to another computer, you can use the New-SshSession cmdlet in PowerShell.
This cmdlet allows you to create an SSH connection to a remote computer and execute commands on it.
You can use the -Cipher parameter to specify the encryption cipher to use for the connection.
