# Used **Algorithms**

This module uses some of the most commonly used encryption algorithms:

- **`AES`** ([Advanced Encryption Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)): AES is a widely-used symmetric encryption algorithm that is known for its strong security and high performance.

It is the standard encryption algorithm used by the U.S. government and is often considered to be one of the most secure encryption algorithms available.

- **`RSA`** ([Rivest-Shamir-Adleman](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)>)): RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that is commonly used for encrypting messages that are sent over the internet.

It is considered to be one of the most secure encryption algorithms, but it can be slow to encrypt large amounts of data.

- **`ECC`** ([Elliptic Curve Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_cryptography)): ECC is a relatively new encryption algorithm that is based on the principles of elliptic curve theory.

It offers strong security and good performance, and is becoming increasingly popular for encrypting data in applications such as mobile devices and internet of things (IoT) devices.

Ultimately, the best encryption algorithm for you will depend on your specific security requirements and the constraints of your application.

but this module is all about being Paranoid and going hardcore as possible so all of the above are mixed/used together.
